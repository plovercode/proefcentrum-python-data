# Introduction to data manipulation in Python

## Introduction

This course is intended for researchers that have at least basic programming skills in Python. It targets researchers that want to enhance their general data manipulation and analysis skills in Python. 

The course does not aim to provide a course in statistics or machine learning. It aims to provide researchers the means to effectively tackle commonly encountered data handling tasks in order to increase the overall efficiency of the research. 


## Getting started

The course uses Python 3 and some data analysis packages such as Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib. For detailed instructions to get started on your local machine , see the [setup instructions](./docs/setup.md).

In case you do not want to install everything and just want to try out the course material, use the environment setup by Binder [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jorisvandenbossche/DS-python-data-analysis/main?urlpath=lab/) and open de notebooks rightaway.
